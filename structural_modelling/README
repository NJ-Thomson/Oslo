Automated MODELLER loop modeling workflow.
This script:
  1. Prompts for a PDB ID
  2. Runs prepare_modeller_from_pdb.py to download and prepare inputs
  3. Runs model_loops.py to generate loop models
  4. Organizes all outputs into a folder named by the PDB ID

Usage:
  ./run_modeller.sh
  ./run_modeller.sh 8WU1   # Can also pass PDB ID as argument

Requirements:
  - Python 3
  - MODELLER (with license configured)
    * Download from https://salilab.org/modeller/
    * License key required (free for academic use)
    * Must be properly installed and importable in Python
  - Python packages:
    * modeller (included with MODELLER installation, required for model_loops.py)
    * requests (pip install requests, required for prepare_modeller_from_pdb.py)
    * Standard library: sys, os, collections
