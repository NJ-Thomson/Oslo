Automated MODELLER loop modeling workflow.
This script:
  1. Prompts for a PDB ID
  2. Runs prepare_modeller_from_pdb.py to download and prepare inputs
  3. Runs model_loops.py to generate loop models
  4. Organizes all outputs into a folder named by the PDB ID

Usage:
  ./run_modeller.sh
  ./run_modeller.sh 8WU1   # Can also pass PDB ID as argument

Requirements:
  - Python 3
  - MODELLER (with license configured)
  - requests module (pip install requests)
